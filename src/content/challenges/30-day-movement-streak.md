## 30 Days to a Fitter Family

They say it takes 21 days to form a habit and 90 days to make it a lifestyle. This 30-day challenge is your family's commitment to making movement a non-negotiable part of every single day.

By Day 30, exercise won't be something you "have to do"—it will be who you are.
