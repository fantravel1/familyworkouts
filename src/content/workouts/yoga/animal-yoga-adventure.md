## Tips for Parents

### Making It Work for Different Ages

**Toddlers (2-3)**
- Keep it super short (5-10 minutes)
- Focus on 3-4 animals only
- Lots of sound effects
- Let them lead sometimes
- Don't worry about "correct" poses

**Preschool (3-5)**
- Can follow longer sequences
- Love adding details: "What color is your butterfly?"
- May want to repeat favorites
- Great with animal music/sounds playing

**Kids (6-8)**
- Can learn Sanskrit names (they think they're cool!)
- Hold poses longer
- Add breathing techniques
- Can help teach younger siblings

### Dealing with Wiggles

- Wiggles are okay! Young children need movement
- Add transitions: "Hop like a frog to your mat!"
- If attention wanders, move to next animal
- End early rather than force it

## Make It Your Own

**Create an Animal Story**
String poses into a narrative:
"The frog hopped to the pond where he met a turtle. They saw a butterfly fly overhead and a snake slither by..."

**Animal Matching Game**
- Say an animal
- Everyone makes up a pose for that animal
- No wrong answers!

**Habitat Hunt**
- Farm animals
- Jungle safari
- Ocean adventure
- Arctic expedition

## Benefits of Family Yoga

- **Physical**: Flexibility, strength, balance
- **Mental**: Focus, calm, body awareness
- **Emotional**: Confidence, self-regulation
- **Social**: Bonding, cooperation, communication
- **Fun**: Shared positive experiences

## Continue the Adventure
