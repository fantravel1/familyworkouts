## Better Together

Partner yoga transforms individual practice into shared experience. You'll support each other, communicate constantly, and create beautiful poses neither could do alone. Plus, it's surprisingly fun!

## Why Partner Yoga is Special

- **Trust building**: Literally supporting each other
- **Communication**: Must talk through each pose
- **Physical connection**: Safe, appropriate touch
- **Shared achievement**: Celebrate together
- **Relationship strengthening**: Quality time embodied

## Partner Pairings

Great combinations:
- Parent + child
- Parent + teen
- Siblings together
- Grandparent + grandchild
- Two adults
- Switch partners throughout!

## Guidelines for Practice

1. **Communicate constantly**: "Ready?" "More?" "Less?"
2. **Start gentle**: You can always go deeper
3. **No forcing**: If it doesn't work, try differently
4. **Laugh freely**: It's supposed to be fun!
5. **Support, don't compete**: You're a team

## Troubleshooting

**"We keep falling!"**
- Lower your expectations
- Falling = learning
- Laugh and try again
- Use a wall for support

**"My partner is too heavy/light"**
- Choose appropriate poses
- Some work better for matched sizes
- Flying poses need size difference

**"We can't stop laughing"**
- GOOD! That's part of it!
- Laughter is yoga too
- Come back to breath, try again

**"This feels awkward"**
- Start with less intimate poses
- Build comfort over time
- It's okay to take breaks
