## Rise and Shine Together

There's something magical about starting the day moving together as a family. This 15-minute flow is designed to wake up your bodies, focus your minds, and connect you before the busy day ahead.

## Why Morning Yoga as a Family?

- **Sets positive tone**: Begin the day with connection, not screens
- **Improves focus**: Kids (and adults) are more alert after movement
- **Builds routine**: Consistency creates healthy habits
- **Quality time**: Guaranteed family moments before schedules separate you
- **Energy without caffeine**: Natural energy boost for everyone

## Before You Begin

- Roll out mats in a circle so everyone can see each other
- Wear comfortable clothes (pajamas work great!)
- Empty stomachs or light snack only
- Phone alarms OFF—be present
- It's okay to be sleepy; let the practice wake you up

## The Morning Flow

### Centering: Connect (1 minute)

Sit comfortably (however that looks for your body):
- Close eyes or soft gaze down
- 3 deep breaths together
- Parent leads: "We're here together. Let's have a good day."
- Set an intention: What do you want to feel today?

### Wake Up the Spine (3 minutes)

**Seated Side Stretch**
- Right arm up and over to left
- Left hand on floor for support
- Breathe into the right side body
- 3 breaths each side
- "Good morning, ribs!"

**Seated Twist**
- Right hand to left knee
- Left hand behind you
- Gentle twist, look over left shoulder
- 3 breaths each side
- "Wake up, spine!"

**Neck Rolls**
- Drop chin to chest
- Slowly roll ear to right shoulder
- Continue rolling head back (gently)
- Roll left ear to left shoulder
- Back to center
- 2 rounds each direction
- "Hello, neck and shoulders!"

### Standing Warm-Up (3 minutes)

**Mountain Pose (Tadasana)**
- Stand tall, feet hip-width apart
- Arms by sides, palms forward
- Roll shoulders back
- Crown of head reaching up
- 5 breaths
- "Stand tall like a mountain!"

**Sun Breath**

- Let go of any remaining sleepiness
- 5 breaths

### Closing: Connect Again (1 minute)

Return to seated circle:
- One deep breath in together
- Long exhale out: "Ahhhhhhh"
- Each person shares one word for how they feel
- Group "Namaste" (hands at heart, small bow)

## Modifications for Everyone

### Kids (6-12)
- Poses can be less precise
- Add fun names: "Chair pose? That's invisible chair!"
- Shorter holds (3 breaths instead of 5)
- Let them demonstrate poses they know

### Teens
- Full expression of poses
- Can lead sections of the practice
- Add bind variations if experienced
- Appreciate their eye rolls; they'll thank you later

### Adults
- Model deep breathing and focus
- Use this time to genuinely de-stress
- Don't correct kids too much—let them explore
- Focus on your own practice while being present

### Seniors/Limited Mobility
- All standing poses can be done in a chair
- Wall support for balance poses
- Smaller range of motion is perfect
- Seated cat/cow instead of standing flows

## Building the Habit

### Week 1:
- Try 3 mornings
- Short and sweet
- Celebrate showing up

### Week 2:
- Aim for 4-5 mornings
- Extend to full 15 minutes
- Notice how you feel on yoga vs. non-yoga mornings

### Week 3+:
- Make it non-negotiable
- Rotate who leads sections
- Add personal favorite poses

## Troubleshooting

**"We don't have time!"**
- Wake up 15 minutes earlier
- 5 minutes is better than nothing
- Do it right out of bed, before anything else

**"My kids won't participate"**
- Start with just parents doing it
- Invite, don't force
- Make it fun, not serious
- Small rewards initially (special breakfast after)

**"We're too sleepy"**
- Start gentler, end more energetically
- Open curtains for natural light
- Play soft energizing music

**"Everyone's at different levels"**
- That's perfect! Model acceptance
- Encourage everyone to listen to their body
- No competition, only connection

## Daily Affirmations to Add

As you hold poses, say together:
- "Today is going to be a good day"
- "I am ready for whatever comes"
- "I am loved and I give love"
- "I can do hard things"
- "I am grateful for this moment"

## Track Your Journey

After practice, quick family check:
- Energy level (1-10)?
- Mood (emoji or word)?
- One thing you're looking forward to today?

Over weeks, you'll see patterns: Family morning yoga = better days ahead.

Rise and shine, yogis! ☀️
