## Sweet Dreams Start Here

The transition from busy day to restful sleep can be challenging for the whole family. This gentle practice helps everyone release the day, calm the nervous system, and prepare for quality sleep.

## The Science of Bedtime Yoga

- **Activates parasympathetic nervous system**: "Rest and digest" mode
- **Releases physical tension**: Stored in muscles throughout the day
- **Reduces cortisol**: The stress hormone that keeps us alert
- **Creates routine**: Signals to brain that sleep is coming
- **Improves sleep quality**: Not just falling asleep, but staying asleep

## Setting the Scene

### Environment
- Dim lights (or use candles/fairy lights)
- Cool temperature
- Quiet space (soft music optional)
- Mats, blankets, or soft floor
- Maybe stuffed animals for little ones

### Timing
- 30-60 minutes before bed
- After bath time (warmth relaxes muscles)
- Before or instead of screens
- Same time each night for best results

## The Bedtime Flow

### Transition: Letting Go of the Day (2 minutes)

Lie on your backs in a circle, heads toward center:

**Day Release Breath**
- Inhale deeply through nose
- Exhale through mouth with a "hahhh" sound
- Imagine exhaling all the busy energy of the day
- 5 rounds

**Share: Best and Hardest**
- Each person shares: "My best moment was... My hardest moment was..."
- No fixing, just listening
- "Now we let it all go"

### Gentle Seated Stretches (4 minutes)

**Easy Pose with Forward Fold**
- Sit cross-legged
- Walk hands forward slowly
- Let forehead rest (on mat or stacked fists)
- Breathe into lower back
- 8 slow breaths
- "Melting into the earth"

**Sleepy Pigeon (Supported)**
- From hands and knees, bring right knee behind right wrist
- Extend left leg back
- Use pillow or blanket under right hip if needed
- Fold forward over right leg
- Rest forehead on arms or pillow
- 5 breaths each side
- "Softening the hips"

**Seated Neck Release**
- Sit comfortably
- Drop right ear to right shoulder
- Let left shoulder relax down
- Left arm can reach toward floor
- 5 breaths each side
- "Releasing the day's weight"

### Floor Poses (6 minutes)

**Supine Twist**
- Lie on back, hug knees to chest
- Drop knees to right
- Arms spread wide
- Look left (or keep head center)
- Let the twist wring out tension
- 5 breaths each side
- "Unwinding the spine"

**Happy Baby**
- Grab outer feet, soles facing ceiling
- Gently pull knees toward armpits
- Rock side to side
- Find your natural rhythm
- 8-10 breaths
- "Returning to baby calm"

**Legs Up the Wall (or in the air)**
- Scoot bottom close to wall
- Rest legs up against wall
- Or keep legs reaching up without wall
- Arms spread or on belly
- Close eyes
- 1-2 minutes
- "Draining the day away"

**Reclining Butterfly**
- Lie on back
- Soles of feet together, knees fall open
- Hands on belly or by sides
- Pillow under each knee for support
- 1 minute
- "Opening the heart for sleep"

### Final Rest: Cloud Drifting (3 minutes)

**Guided Relaxation (Parent reads slowly)**

"Lie on your back... let your body be heavy...

Starting at your toes... let them relax...
Feel your feet becoming soft... your ankles loose...
Your legs are sinking into clouds...

Let your hips be heavy... your belly soft...
With each breath, you sink deeper into the cloud...

Your back releases... your shoulders drop away from your ears...
Your arms are so relaxed... fingers gently curled...

Your neck is soft... your jaw unclenches...
Your forehead smooths... all the thinking melts away...

You're floating on a peaceful cloud...
Nothing to do... nowhere to go...
Just floating... breathing... resting...

(Pause for 30-60 seconds of silence)

When you're ready... wiggle your fingers and toes gently...
Give yourself a small hug...
Roll to your side like a sleepy little bug...
And when you're ready... sit up slowly..."

## Age Adaptations

### Toddlers & Preschoolers
- Keep it to 5-8 minutes
- Skip complex poses; focus on breathing and lying still
- Use visualization: "Imagine you're a sleepy bunny in a burrow"
- Physical contact: Lie next to them, gentle hand on belly
- May transition directly to bed

### Kids (6-12)
- Full sequence works well
- Let them help read the relaxation script
- They might have wiggles at first—that's okay
- Consistency builds the calming response over time

### Teens
- May act "too cool" but often need this the most
- Science-based explanation helps: "This activates your vagus nerve..."
- Let them listen to their own calm music
- Solo practice in their room works too

### Adults
- Model genuine relaxation
- This benefits your sleep just as much
- Resist urge to check phone during rest
- Practice the breathing techniques you're teaching

## Enhancing the Practice

### Aromatherapy
- Lavender: Classic sleep scent
- Chamomile: Calming and gentle
- Use diffuser or spray on pillows
- Let kids pick their favorite calming scent

### Sound
- Nature sounds (rain, ocean, forest)
- Soft instrumental music
- Singing bowls
- Parental humming or soft singing

### Touch
- Gentle back rub during final rest
- Weighted blanket during relaxation
- Stuffed animal on belly for breathing awareness

## Troubleshooting Sleep Issues

**"I can't stop thinking!"**
- Focus on breath: Count inhales and exhales
- Body scan: Attention moving through body leaves no room for thoughts
- "Thoughts are clouds; let them float by"

**"My body feels restless"**
- More active yoga earlier in evening
- Progressive muscle tension/release
- Gentle self-massage of feet, hands, scalp

**"I'm scared of the dark/bad dreams"**
- Add positive visualization: "Imagine a place where you feel safe and happy"
- Create a "dream protector" (stuffed animal, special item)
- Brief worry time earlier in evening (not at bedtime)

## Creating the Habit

### Week 1: Introduction
- Try 3 nights
- Even partial practice counts
- Notice any differences in falling asleep

### Week 2: Building
- 5 nights
- Consistent time
- Add preferred enhancements (scent, sound)

### Week 3+: Routine
- Non-negotiable family ritual
- Bodies begin to anticipate sleep
- Quality of sleep improves

## Track the Magic

Keep a family sleep journal (optional):
- How long to fall asleep?
- Wake-ups during night?
- Morning energy level?
- Compare yoga nights vs. non-yoga nights

Most families notice improvement within 2 weeks!

## Final Thought

In our always-on world, the gift of truly winding down together is precious. This time says: "The day is done. We are safe. We are together. Rest now."

Sweet dreams, sleepy yogis. 🌙
