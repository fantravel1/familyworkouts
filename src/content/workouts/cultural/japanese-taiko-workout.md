## The Thunder of Taiko!

Taiko (太鼓) means "drum" in Japanese, but it's SO much more than that. It's a physical discipline, a meditation, and an explosive expression of energy. This workout captures the spirit of taiko drumming through movement.

## Why Taiko Training is Amazing

- **Full-body power**: Legs, core, arms, and spirit
- **Rhythm focus**: Mind-body coordination
- **Controlled intensity**: Power with precision
- **Stress release**: Hit imaginary drums HARD
- **Cultural depth**: Ancient art meets modern fitness

## What You'll Need

- **Imaginary drums** (or real ones if you have them!)
- **Optional**: Drumsticks, wooden spoons, or just your hands
- **Space to move**: Arms need room to swing
- **Bare feet recommended**: Traditional and grounding

## Taiko Principles

### Kiai (気合) - Spirit Shout
- Vocal expressions of energy

- "SO-RE!" - Call to begin
- Shouting focuses power and releases energy

### Kata (形) - Form
- Specific body positions
- Wide, stable stances
- Full arm extensions
- Powerful, controlled movements

### Ma (間) - Space/Pause
