## About Capoeira

Capoeira is a unique Afro-Brazilian cultural practice that blends martial arts, dance, acrobatics, and music into one beautiful art form. Developed by enslaved Africans in Brazil, it was disguised as a dance to hide its martial arts origins.

## Why Families Love Capoeira

- **No competition**: Everyone plays together in the "roda" (circle)
- **Music integration**: Learn to clap, sing, and move together
- **All skill levels welcome**: Each person moves at their own pace
- **Cultural education**: Learn Portuguese words and Brazilian history
- **Full-body workout**: Builds strength, flexibility, and coordination

## Today's Workout Structure

### Warm-Up: Ginga Basics (5 minutes)
The ginga is the fundamental movement of capoeira—a rhythmic swaying motion.

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Step back with right foot, shift weight
3. Return to center, step back with left foot
4. Add arm movements: opposite arm forward
5. Find your rhythm with the music

### Main Movements (15 minutes)

**Negativa (Defensive Crouch)**
- Drop to one side, one leg extended
- One hand on ground for support
- Great for building leg strength
- Kids love this "superhero landing" pose

**Cocorinha (Squat Defense)**
- Deep squat with one arm protecting face
- Other arm for balance
- Excellent for hip mobility
- Challenge: Who can hold it longest?

**Meia Lua de Frente (Front Half Moon Kick)**
- Standing position, weight on back leg
- Swing front leg in arc across body
- Keep leg straight but not locked
- Family activity: Partners take turns, respecting space

**Aú (Cartwheel)**
- Start with hand placement on ground
- Kick legs over one at a time
- Progression: Wall-assisted → spotted → independent
- Parents: Spot younger children

### Cool-Down & Roda Practice (5 minutes)
- Form a family circle
- Practice call-and-response clapping
- Take turns entering the "roda" to show one move
- End with group ginga together

## Family Adaptations

### For Younger Children (5-7)
- Focus on ginga and basic animal movements
- Use "animal names": "caranguejo" (crab walk), "macaco" (monkey)
- Shorter sessions (10-15 minutes)
- More music and clapping time

### For Teens
- Add more acrobatic elements
- Introduce basic sequences (combinations)
- Explore the competitive "jogo" (game) aspect
- Research capoeira history together

### For Grandparents
- Chair-supported ginga
- Focus on upper body movements and clapping
- Musical participation (clapping patterns)
- Storytelling about capoeira history

## Safety Tips

1. Clear a large space—capoeira needs room
2. Soft surface preferred (carpet, grass, mats)
3. No kicking contact—movements flow around partner
4. Start slow, increase speed as comfort grows
5. Stay hydrated—it's a cardio workout!

## Cultural Connection

Teach children these Portuguese capoeira terms:
- **Ginga**: The basic swaying movement
- **Roda**: The circle where capoeira happens
- **Berimbau**: The main musical instrument
- **Axé**: Energy, life force
- **Mandinga**: Trickery, playfulness in movement

## Challenge of the Week

Create a family "apelido" (nickname) for each person based on their capoeira style. Traditional nicknames might describe how someone moves or their personality in the roda.
