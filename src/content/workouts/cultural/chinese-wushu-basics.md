## 欢迎 (Huānyíng) - Welcome!

Wushu, meaning "martial art" in Chinese, encompasses hundreds of fighting styles developed over thousands of years. Today's practice draws from foundational movements that build strength, flexibility, and focus.

## The Philosophy of Wushu

**武术 (Wǔshù)** - Martial Arts
- 武 (Wǔ) = Martial, military
- 术 (Shù) = Art, technique

Wushu is as much about character as combat:
- **Discipline**: Consistent practice
- **Respect**: For teachers, training partners, self
- **Perseverance**: Improvement through repetition
- **Balance**: Physical and mental harmony

## Why Wushu is Amazing for Families

- **Focus development**: Attention to precise movements
- **Flexibility**: Deep stances require mobility
- **Strength**: Holding positions builds muscles
- **Confidence**: Martial arts empower all ages
- **Cultural depth**: Ancient wisdom meets fitness

## Wushu Principles

### Jīng (精) - Essence/Precision
Every movement has purpose. Execute with accuracy.

### Qì (气) - Energy/Breath
Breath powers movement. Coordinate breathing with action.

### Shén (神) - Spirit
Your eyes and intention. Look where you strike!
