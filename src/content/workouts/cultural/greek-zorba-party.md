## Cultural Connection

**Share with your family:**

### About Sirtaki
- Created in 1964 for the film "Zorba the Greek"
- Choreographer: Giorgos Provias
- Combines two traditional Greek dances: hasapiko (slow) and hasaposerviko (fast)
- "Sirtaki" comes from Greek word "to drag" (the slow dragging steps)

### Greek Dance Traditions
- Dancing is central to Greek celebrations
- Line and circle dances symbolize community
- "Kefi" - the spirit of joy, passion, enthusiasm
- Breaking plates: Expressing overwhelming emotion!

### Greek Words to Use
- *Opa!* - Expression of joy/excitement
- *Yassou* - Cheers/hello
- *Kefi* - Joy, high spirits
- *Siga-siga* - Slowly, slowly (for the slow part!)
- *Pame!* - Let's go!

## Music

**Classic Tracks:**

## The Science of the Build-Up

Why the slow-to-fast format is brilliant:

1. **Warm-up built in**: Slow phase prepares muscles
2. **Anticipation**: Building excitement releases dopamine
3. **Interval training**: Natural HIIT structure
4. **Communal crescendo**: Group energy amplifies
5. **Satisfying payoff**: Fast finale feels earned
