## The Magic of Irish Dance

Irish dance is known for its rapid leg movements while keeping the upper body still—a unique and challenging style that builds incredible leg strength and coordination. Don't worry about being perfect; focus on feeling the Celtic rhythm!

## Benefits of Irish Dance for Families

- **Exceptional cardio**: Gets heart rates up quickly
- **Leg strength**: Builds powerful legs and calves
- **Coordination**: Right and left leg independence
- **Musical appreciation**: Learn about Celtic music
- **Posture improvement**: Emphasis on upright carriage

## Understanding Irish Dance

### Two Main Styles
1. **Soft shoe**: Light, balletic movements (what we'll focus on)
2. **Hard shoe**: Rhythmic, percussive (like tap dancing)

### The Traditional Posture
- Arms down at sides (originally to fit small spaces!)
- Back straight, chin up
- All the action in the feet and legs
- Light on your feet

## Workout Structure

### Warm-Up: Rise and Point (4 minutes)

**Calf Raises**
- Rise up on toes, hold 2 counts
- Lower with control
- 10 repetitions
- This prepares feet for dancing on toes

**Point and Flex**
- Extend one leg, point toe
- Flex foot back
- 8 each side
- Builds foot articulation

**March in Place**
- High knees, pointed toes
- Arms stay at sides
- Find the rhythm
- 1 minute
