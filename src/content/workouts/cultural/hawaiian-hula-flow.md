## Aloha! Welcome to Hula

Hula is far more than dance—it's storytelling, history, and spiritual practice. Every hand gesture (hula hands) tells part of a story. Every step honors the land and ancestors. Today, we'll learn basic movements while discovering the beauty of Hawaiian culture.

## The Heart of Hula

**"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people."** — King David Kalākaua

## Why Hula is Perfect for Families

- **Story-based**: Engaging narrative keeps attention
- **Gentle on joints**: Low-impact with deep muscle work
- **Core-intensive**: Constant hip and abdominal engagement
- **Meditative**: Flowing movements calm the mind
- **Intergenerational**: Grandparents to toddlers can participate
- **Meaningful**: Learn about Hawaiian culture

## Understanding Hula

### Two Types of Hula
- **Hula kahiko**: Ancient, traditional style with chants
- **Hula ʻauana**: Modern style with contemporary music

Today we'll focus on accessible movements from both!

### Key Principles
- **Pono**: Righteousness, being proper in your practice
- **Aloha**: Love and respect for the dance
- **Mālama**: Care for the tradition
- **Kuleana**: Responsibility to honor the culture
