## Hoops for Everyone!

Basketball is one of the best family activities—it's active, skill-based, and endlessly adaptable. Whether you have a driveway hoop, park court, or even a laundry basket inside, these drills work for everyone!

## What You'll Need

- Basketball (size appropriate—smaller for young kids)
- Hoop of any kind (adjustable height ideal)
- Flat surface

## Why Basketball for Families?

- **Scalable difficulty**: Lower hoop, smaller ball for little ones
- **Turn-based**: Natural rest periods
- **Life skills**: Teaches teamwork, practice, perseverance
- **Indoor/outdoor**: Adaptable to any weather
- **All ages**: Grandma can shoot too!

- **Support each other**: Cheer teammates, encourage family
- **Have fun**: The real goal!

Nothing but net! 🏀
