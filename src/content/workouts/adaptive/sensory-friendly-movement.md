## A Safe Space to Move 💙

This workout is designed for individuals who benefit from predictable, calm, sensory-aware movement. There are no sudden changes, loud sounds, or unexpected elements. Everything follows a clear structure that you can learn and rely on.

## Who This Is For

- Children and adults with autism spectrum disorder
- People with sensory processing differences
- Those who feel overwhelmed by typical workout environments
- Anyone who prefers calm, predictable exercise
- Families with mixed sensory needs

## Design Principles

✓ **Predictable structure**: Same format every time
✓ **Visual supports**: Clear descriptions of each movement
✓ **Calm environment**: No loud music required
✓ **Proprioceptive input**: Grounding, "heavy work" movements
✓ **Choice and control**: Options at every step
✓ **No surprises**: You always know what comes next

## Before We Start

### Environment Setup
- Quiet space with minimal distractions
- Dim or natural lighting (avoid harsh fluorescents)
- Comfortable temperature
- Yoga mat or soft carpet
- Remove visual clutter if possible
- Timer visible (so you know how much longer)

### Optional Comfort Items
- Weighted blanket nearby (for cool-down)
- Fidget tool for waiting moments
- Noise-canceling headphones if needed
- Favorite stuffed animal or object
