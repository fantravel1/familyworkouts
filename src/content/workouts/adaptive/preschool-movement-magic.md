# Preschool Movement Magic

Welcome to the most magical workout for our littlest movers! Simple, fun, and full of imagination—because at this age, play IS exercise.

## The Preschool Philosophy

At ages 3-5, children need:
- **Unstructured play**: Not every moment needs instruction
- **Simple movements**: Building blocks for later skills
- **Imagination**: Make-believe makes exercise fun
- **Short bursts**: Attention spans are short
- **Lots of praise**: Every attempt is celebrated!

## What Success Looks Like

✅ Laughing and having fun
✅ Moving their bodies
✅ Trying new things
✅ Building confidence
✅ Positive associations with exercise

❌ Perfect form
❌ Following every instruction exactly
❌ Sitting still
❌ Long attention spans
