# Tabata Tots: 4-Minute Family Bursts

The Tabata protocol is perfect for little ones—short bursts that match their natural energy! 20 seconds of work, 10 seconds rest, 8 rounds = 4 minutes of magic.

## Why Tabata Works for Families

- **Only 4 minutes per round**: Short attention spans? No problem!
- **Built-in rest**: 10-second breaks prevent burnout
- **Measurable progress**: Count reps, beat your record
- **Stackable**: Do 1 round or 5 based on energy
- **No equipment**: Start instantly anywhere

## The Tabata Formula

20 seconds WORK
10 seconds REST
× 8 rounds
= 4 minutes total
