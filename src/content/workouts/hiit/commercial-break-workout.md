## Don't Just Watch—MOVE! 📺💪

The average TV show has 15-22 minutes of commercials per hour. That's FREE workout time just sitting there! Turn mindless ad breaks into exercise bursts with this sneaky-fit workout.

## The Concept

- **Watch your show**: Enjoy it!
- **Commercial break starts**: WORKOUT TIME!
- **Commercial break ends**: Return to show
- **Repeat**: Throughout the entire program
- **Result**: 15-20 minutes of exercise without "working out"!

---

## How It Works

### The Rules
1. When commercials start, you START
2. When the show returns, you STOP
3. No pausing commercials on DVR (honor system!)
4. Everyone in the room participates
5. Cheer each other on during breaks!

### Average Commercial Breaks
- **Regular TV**: 4-5 breaks per hour, 3-4 minutes each
- **Sports**: More frequent, longer breaks
- **Kids' shows**: Shorter breaks (1-2 minutes)
- **Streaming with ads**: Perfect micro-workouts

## Workout Format Options

### Option 1: Single Exercise Per Break

**How it works:**
- Pick ONE exercise for the entire break
- Do it until the show returns
- Different exercise each break

**Example during a movie:**
- Break 1: Squats
- Break 2: Push-ups
- Break 3: Jumping jacks
- Break 4: Plank
- Break 5: Lunges

### Option 2: Exercise Rotation

**How it works:**
- Switch exercises every 30 seconds during break
- Timer or just feel it out
- Variety keeps it interesting

**Example for a 3-minute break:**
- 30 sec: Jumping jacks
- 30 sec: Squats
- 30 sec: High knees
- 30 sec: Push-ups
- 30 sec: Mountain climbers
- 30 sec: Plank

### Option 3: Commercial Theme Match

**How it works:**
- Match exercise to ad theme
- Gets creative and silly!
- Kids especially love this

**Ad-Exercise Pairings:**
- Car ad → Running/driving motions
- Food ad → Chewing motions (jaw exercises?) / Burpees to earn it!
- Medicine ad → Healing stretches
- Insurance ad → Protective planks
- Tech ad → Robot moves
- Sports ad → That sport's moves!

### Option 4: Family Challenge

**How it works:**
- One person picks the exercise
- Everyone does it together
- Rotate picker each break

*All without missing your shows!*

2. **Stop when show returns** (reward for compliance)
3. **Keep water nearby** (stay hydrated!)
4. **Wear comfortable clothes** (or workout clothes!)
5. **Clear a small space** (in front of TV)
6. **Make it social** (more fun with family)
