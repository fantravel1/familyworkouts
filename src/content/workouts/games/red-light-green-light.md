# Red Light, Green Light Fitness Edition

This timeless game is actually a perfect interval workout in disguise! Sprint bursts + freeze holds = serious fitness gains for the whole family.

## Why This Game Is Fitness Gold

- **Natural HIIT**: Sprint/stop intervals boost metabolism
- **Isometric holds**: Freezing builds muscle endurance
- **Core engagement**: Stopping suddenly requires core strength
- **Reaction time**: Improves neuromuscular connection
- **Zero equipment**: Play anywhere with space to run

## Classic Rules (Quick Review)

1. One person is the "Traffic Light" (faces away from players)
2. Players line up at a starting line
3. **GREEN LIGHT**: Players move toward the finish
4. **RED LIGHT**: Traffic Light turns around, players FREEZE
5. Anyone caught moving goes back to start
6. First to reach the Traffic Light wins and becomes the new light!
