# Space Explorer Training Camp

Welcome to Mission Control! Today you begin your astronaut training. Real astronauts train for years—you've got 25 minutes. Let's make every second count!

## Mission Briefing

Why train like astronauts?
- **Full-body fitness**: Space requires total body strength
- **Balance and coordination**: Essential for zero gravity
- **Endurance**: Long missions need stamina
- **Mental focus**: Concentration is key
- **Teamwork**: Crews work together
