## Making It Work for Mixed Ages

The beauty of family fitness is adapting so everyone participates:

### During Dance Workouts
- **Toddler**: Bounces and spins freely
- **Child**: Follows choreography loosely
- **Teen**: Adds advanced moves
- **Adult**: Models full participation
- **Senior**: Focuses on upper body, seated option

### During Strength Workouts
- **Child**: Bodyweight only, fewer reps
- **Teen**: Full exercises, moderate challenge
- **Adult**: Full exercises, appropriate weight
- **Senior**: Modified exercises, chair support available

### The Golden Rule
**Everyone does the SAME activity at their OWN level.**

No one sits out. Everyone belongs.
